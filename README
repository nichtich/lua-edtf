NAME

    lua-edtf - experimental Lua module to parse extended date/time format

BACKGROUND

    The Library of Congress works on an Extended Date/Time Format (EDTF):
      http://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/

    I play around with the Lua programming language and formal grammars.

    This module defines a formal grammar to parse (currently a subset of) 
    the proposed EDTF. The grammar is not written as context-free language
    in Backus-Naur Form, but as Parsing Expression Grammar (PEG).

REQUIREMENTS

    You need a Lua interpreter and LPeg pattern matching library for Lua:
      http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg/

    The Debian package 'liblua5.1-lpeg2' simplifies installation.

USAGE

    The script 'examples.lua' contains examples and test cases.

STATUS
   
    This module is purely experimental, it only covers a small subset of
    the proposed EDTF. I have no intention to finish the parser, but maybe
    it is of use to someone. Feel free to extend and fork this project:
